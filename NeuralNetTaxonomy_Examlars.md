## Neural Net Taxonomy and Exemplars
### Purpose
Define major categories of problems being solved or attempted using neural nets.  For each category, it would be useful to list the top performing designs, available data sets, useful videos, blogs etc.  The goal would be to identify useful material for those of us undertaking new projects and to identify areas that seem relatively mature and areas that are being researched actively.  Some areas have multiple contenders being used in commercial applications and in other areas, perforemance hasn't reached commercial viability.  

Please feel free to make suggestions in the form of pull requests.  This will go faster and be more nourishing as a group effort. 

Here are some category proposals:

## Image Processing
#### Classification
#### Object Detection
#### Semantic Segmentation
#### Bounding boxes

## Speech Processing
#### Speech to text
#### Text to speech

## Text Processing

## Reinforcement Learning
